# Strategy Pattern in Go â€“ Interview Quick Reference

This document demonstrates the **Strategy Design Pattern** using Go, with a real-world use case: vehicle driving behavior. It's tailored to help you **explain and implement the pattern during interviews**, with clean code and practical explanations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Strategy Pattern?

The **Strategy Pattern** is used to define a family of interchangeable algorithms (strategies), encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable at runtime. This promotes:

- âœ… **Separation of concerns** â€“ Behavior logic is separate from core object structure
- âœ… **Runtime flexibility** â€“ Behavior can change without modifying structs
- âœ… **Open/Closed Principle** â€“ Open to new strategies, closed to modifying base types
- âœ… **Testability** â€“ Strategies can be independently tested

## ðŸ›  Use Case: Vehicle Drive Behavior

We model three types of vehicles:

- **PassengerVehicle** â†’ drives normally  
- **OffroadVehicle** â†’ drives off-road  
- **SportsVehicle** â†’ drives fast/agile  

Each vehicle has a drive capability, which varies based on type.

## ðŸš« Without Strategy Pattern

All logic resides in child structs overriding parent behavior (tight coupling):

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Vehicle interface {
	Drive()
}

type PassengerVehicle struct{}

func (p *PassengerVehicle) Drive() {
	fmt.Println("Driving on regular roads")
}

type OffroadVehicle struct{}

func (o *OffroadVehicle) Drive() {
	fmt.Println("Driving on rough off-road terrain")
}

type SportsVehicle struct{}

func (s *SportsVehicle) Drive() {
	fmt.Println("Driving at high speed with agility")
}

func main() {
	var v Vehicle

	v = &PassengerVehicle{}
	v.Drive()

	v = &OffroadVehicle{}
	v.Drive()

	v = &SportsVehicle{}
	v.Drive()
}
