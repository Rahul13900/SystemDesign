# Decorator Design Pattern in Go

## Overview

The **Decorator Design Pattern** allows you to dynamically add behavior to an object without modifying its structure. This pattern is useful when you want to enhance an object's functionality in a flexible and reusable way, especially in systems that require multiple features like logging, authentication, and rate-limiting.

In Go, the decorator pattern is implemented using **functions**, **interfaces**, and **composition**, which allows us to wrap handlers or functions with additional functionality.

## Core Concept

The **Decorator Pattern** enables you to:

- Add new functionality to an object (in this case, an HTTP handler) without modifying its structure.
- Wrap the original object multiple times, adding more and more functionality dynamically.
- Keep the core logic of the object unchanged.

This pattern is particularly useful in backend systems that require cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication, and rate-limiting.

### Key Features:
- **Function Composition**: In Go, decorators are typically implemented using function composition, where each decorator wraps the next one, adding more behavior as needed.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: You can add new decorators (features) without changing the core logic of your application.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each decorator focuses on a specific concern (e.g., logging, authentication, etc.), making the code more maintainable.

## How It Works

In Go, decorators are often used in **middleware** functions for HTTP handlers. Each decorator is a function that takes a handler as input and returns a new handler with additional behavior.

### Example Scenario:
- **Base Handler**: This is your original functionality, such as responding with a simple message.
- **Decorator 1**: Adds logging to the handler by printing details about each request.
- **Decorator 2**: Adds authentication by checking if a valid token is provided in the request.
- **Decorator 3**: Adds rate-limiting by limiting the number of requests that can be processed in a given time frame.

Decorators can be composed together to create complex behavior by stacking them. The order in which they are applied matters, as each decorator wraps the handler and can either modify the request before passing it to the next decorator or process the response afterward.

## Advantages of the Decorator Pattern

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each decorator is responsible for a single task, such as logging, authentication, or rate-limiting. This keeps your code clean and modular.
2. **Flexibility**: Decorators allow you to add or remove functionality dynamically, without changing the underlying code.
3. **Composability**: Decorators can be combined in various ways, allowing you to mix and match different behaviors without creating a complex inheritance structure.
4. **Maintainability**: Since each feature is encapsulated in a separate decorator, itâ€™s easier to modify or extend specific functionality without affecting the entire system.
5. **Open/Closed Principle**: You can extend your system's functionality without modifying the existing code, making it easier to maintain and evolve over time.

## Conclusion

The **Decorator Pattern** is a powerful design pattern that enables you to add behavior to objects in a flexible and modular way. By using decorators, you can enhance existing functionality, apply multiple features like logging, authentication, and rate-limiting, and maintain clean, readable code without altering the core components.

This pattern is particularly useful in backend systems that require cross-cutting concerns and is widely used in HTTP request handling, where middleware functions act as decorators.
